Landing page for a real-estate business - built entirely with grid from overall layout to
small nested components. I love the drastically reduced necessity for media queries that the grid system provides. I was amazed at how naturally responsive grid layouts can be, especially when utilizing features like auto-fit and minmax.

I wanted to be able to randomise the grid structure of the gallery, however after some long-winded attempts at figuring out a solution, it became clear I had underestimated the complexity of implementing that, so instead I settled for simply randomising the order of the images while keeping the grid structure static.
