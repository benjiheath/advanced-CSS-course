Small collection of projects following Jonas Schmedtmann's [Advanced CSS & SASS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). Coding along in React.

My focus here is to improve my responsive design skills and learn how to more efficiently structure markup & styling. Currently using SASS for the first project, however I'd like to learn Styled Components while building the Trillo & Nexter projects.
