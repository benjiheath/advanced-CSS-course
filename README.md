Small collection of projects following Jonas Schmedtmann's [Advanced CSS & SASS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). Coding along in React.

My focus here is to improve my responsive design skills and learn how to structure markup & styling more efficiently. The course calls for SASS however I'll be using Styled Components for the Trillo & Nexter projects.

## projects

#### Natours

-->[Demo](https://stoic-morse-58a662.netlify.app/)<--

A mock landing page for an adventure tours business. Mostly focused on animations and maintaining theme. Lots of absolute positioning etc however I use flexbox where the tutorial calls for floats. Here I pick up SASS and attempt to make the page responsive for all screen widths.

#### Trillo

Travel/booking app, centered around the use of flexbox. For this I used Styled Components.
