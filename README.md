Small collection of projects following Jonas Schmedtmann's [Advanced CSS & SASS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). Coding along in React.

My focus here is to improve my responsive design skills and learn how to structure markup & styling more efficiently. The course calls for SASS however I'll be using Styled Components for the Trillo & Nexter projects.

A mock landing page for an adventure tours business. Mostly focused on animations and maintaining theme. Here I pick up SASS and make the page responsive for all screen widths.

Landing page for a real-estate business - built entirely with grid from overall layout to
small nested components. I love the drastically reduced necessity for media queries that the grid system provides. I was amazed at how naturally responsive grid layouts can be, especially when utilizing features like auto-fit and minmax.

I wanted to be able to randomise the grid structure of the gallery, however after some long-winded attempts at figuring out a solution, it became clear I had underestimated the complexity of implementing that, so instead I settled for simply randomising the order of the images while keeping the grid structure static.
